All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`planka_get_card` is a digest with detail on demand.** By default it returns
  counts and names instead of the whole record: `listName` next to `listId`,
  label **names** with their ids, `members`, tasks as `{done, total, lists:[…]}`
  with one entry per checklist, `attachmentsCount`, Planka's own `commentsTotal`,
  `dueDate`/`isDueCompleted`/`isClosed`/`updatedAt`, and a 200-char
  `descriptionPreview` (with `descriptionChars`, `descriptionTruncated`).
  New parameters: `detail: "digest" | "full"`, `withComments` (a number or
  `"all"`), `descriptionChars`. Measured on a real card with 6 comments and 5
  attachments: **1275 chars against 13 187** for the old always-everything
  answer — 90 % less, with the column name and the label names it never had.
- `planka_get_comments` paginates honestly: `limit` (default 20, max 50),
  `beforeId` as an in/out cursor, `hasMore`, `nextBeforeId`, `order`
  (`"asc"` — oldest first — by default) and `all: true` with a 10-page ceiling
  that reports `truncated`. `getComments()` / `getCommentsPage()` in
  `src/operations/comments.ts` are the operations behind it.
- `getBoardNames()`: the one board read that resolves a card's `listId` and
  `labelId`s to names, memoized for 60 s. Best effort by design — a board that
  cannot be read costs the names, never the card.
- 23 unit tests: digest vs full, `withComments` 0/N/`"all"` against a mocked
  two-page endpoint, checklists that stay apart, members, the description
  preview, the comment cursor and its ceiling, and one per error branch.
  Suite: 109 → 132 tests.
- **Eight new tools, 24 → 32.** All of them answer with a digest and every write
  re-reads before reporting:
  - `planka_card_history` and `planka_board_activity` read Planka's activity log
    (`/api/cards/:id/actions`, `/api/boards/:id/actions`) and turn each event
    into one human line — "moved from X to Y", "added member Z", "completed task
    T". `board_activity` walks pages backwards to a `since` date (5-page cap,
    reported as `truncated`) and groups the result by card. Both say, when they
    return nothing, that Planka logs only creation, moves, member changes and
    task completion — never comments, renames or description edits.
  - `planka_set_card_members` assigns and unassigns people, accepting user IDs
    or names, and reports `finalMemberIds` read back from the card. The mirror
    of `planka_set_card_labels`, argument for argument.
  - `planka_list_users` lists who can be assigned, falling back to the board's
    own members when `GET /api/users` is refused (it is admin-only) and saying
    so in `source`. Emails only with `detail: "full"`.
  - `planka_whoami` names the account, its board role, the Planka version and
    the local access policy — the first call to make when a `404` makes no
    sense. Warns when the instance is not a Planka 2.x.
  - `planka_duplicate_card` copies a card with its tasks, labels and members
    (attachments are not copied) and reports the counts from re-reading the copy.
  - `planka_archive_card` archives into the board's hidden `archive` list and
    restores with `restoreToListId`. Verified by the card's column: `isClosed`
    does NOT change on archive, so it proves nothing.
  - `planka_move_list_cards` empties one column into another, counting both
    columns before and after. It uses Planka's bulk endpoint only for the case
    that endpoint accepts (a closed column into the archive) and moves card by
    card otherwise, preserving each card's position; `strategy` reports which.
- `src/operations/card-brief.ts`: a permissive card read used for verification.
  An archived card comes back with `position: null`, which the strict card
  schema rejects — the archive tool could not have verified its own write
  without it. It also exposes `cardMemberships`, which no other read did.
- `countListCards()` and `moveListCards()` in `src/operations/lists.ts`, plus
  `src/operations/{actions,members,users,archive,duplicate}.ts`.
- The four new write tools are in `WRITE_TOOL_NAMES`, so `PLANKA_READ_ONLY`
  hides them, and `planka_archive_card` and `planka_move_list_cards` carry
  `anthropic/requiresUserInteraction`: both change what a whole column looks
  like.
- 32 unit tests for the new surface (fetch mocked): one summary per event type,
  the `since` sweep and its cursor, the 403 fallback of the user roster, the
  archive-list resolution, and the two failures that must not read as success —
  a membership that never landed and a bulk move whose counts do not add up.
  Suite: 109 → 141 tests.
- Smoke: the new tools are exercised end to end and cross-checked against the
  raw API — history after a real move and a real assignment, a duplicate, an
  archive/restore round trip, and a bulk move between the smoke's temporary
  column and its working column. Every card it creates is deleted in the
  `finally`.
- Server instructions gained one line: `planka_board_activity` is the call to
  make when resuming a board someone else left.

- `src/operations/verify.ts`: `verifiedWrite`, `verifiedDelete` and `goneOn404`,
  the single implementation of "write, re-read, report what landed". Until now
  the pattern lived hand-copied in two places and was missing from eleven writes.
- Every write reports `verified: true|false`, and `isError` when the re-read
  contradicts it or could not be made. New response fields: `verificationError`,
  `verificationUnavailable`, `partialFailure`, `notLanded`.
- `planka_move_card` accepts `boardId`, so a card can finally be moved between
  boards (the operation supported it; the tool did not expose it).
- `planka_update_task`, `planka_delete_task` and `planka_delete_attachment`
  accept an optional `cardId`, which is what makes their verification possible
  (Planka 2.x has no GET for a single task).
- `getCardLight()`: a card read without its comments, used for verification and
  by `planka_set_card_labels`, which was pulling every comment of a card twice
  only to compare label ids.
- 19 unit tests for the false greens: comments endpoint failing, partial task
  creation, deletes that do not delete, no-op PATCHes, a move that did not move,
  and labels that never attached. Suite: 45 → 64 tests.
- Smoke: a REAL move between two columns (temporary column created, card moved
  there and back, both directions cross-checked against the raw API) and
  `verified: true` assertions on every write.


- **Board reads redesigned around one principle: a small digest by default, the
  detail through parameters.** `planka_find_cards` is now the single read over
  cards and takes `listId`, `listName`, `query`, `labelName` (alias
  `labelFilter`), `labelIds`, `userIds`, `withLabels`, `detail`
  (`"digest" | "full"`), `withDescription`, `descriptionChars`, `limit` and
  `offset`.
- `planka_find_cards` with a `listId` reads the column through
  `GET /api/lists/:id`: **one request, no cursor**, so `total` is the real size
  of the column and the answer carries `truncated: false`. A 159-card column
  went from five requests to two (one with `withLabels: false`).
- The card digest now carries `members`, `commentsTotal` and `updatedAt`, and
  `detail: "full"` returns every field Planka gave, description included.
- `planka_board_summary` absorbs `planka_list_lists`: `cardsFrom: []` answers
  columns and labels with no cards. It also reports `totalCards`.
- `warnings` on `planka_board_summary` and `planka_find_cards`: a `cardsFrom`
  entry, a `listName` or a `highlightLabel` that matches nothing comes back
  naming what does exist, instead of an empty result that reads like "there is
  nothing there".
- `PLANKA_SUMMARY_DECISION_LISTS` and `PLANKA_SUMMARY_HIGHLIGHT_LABEL`: the
  board vocabulary that used to be hardcoded in Spanish inside the server now
  comes from the environment, and defaults to nothing.
- `planka_get_structure` takes `withLists` (default `true`). With `false` the
  whole structure is ONE request instead of one board read per board — 203
  characters against 696 on the reference instance.
- `planka_get_board` takes `limit` (default 50) and reports `totalCards`,
  `returnedCards` and `truncated`.
- `excludesArchived: true` on every read derived from the board show, and a new
  gotcha documenting why: `GET /api/boards/:id` carries no archive and no trash
  cards, and there is no way to ask for them.
- `query` semantics are now Planka's own: several words are ANDed, and a leading
  `/` makes the rest a case-insensitive regular expression. A broken regex is
  reported instead of matching nothing.
- 18 unit tests for the redesigned reads (list path, digest vs full, aliases,
  warnings, derived page size, `excludesArchived`, `withLists`). Suite: 116 →
  134 tests.

### Deprecated

- **`planka_get_board`.** Its description now starts with
  `DEPRECATED: use planka_board_summary + planka_find_cards`. It stays
  functional, and it is capped: 56,112 → 17,215 characters on the reference
  board.
- `planka_list_lists` and `planka_list_cards` are kept as **aliases** —
  respectively `planka_board_summary` with `cardsFrom: []` and
  `planka_find_cards` with `listId`. Same implementation, same response shape;
  the tool count and every tool name are unchanged.

### Changed

- **`planka_get_card` no longer returns comments by default.** They were the
  biggest and least predictable part of the answer and most reads do not need
  them; `withComments` brings them back, and the digest always says how many
  exist (`commentsTotal`). Comments come back **oldest first**, the order the
  thread was written.
- `commentCount` in `planka_get_comments` is documented and reported as what
  *that response* carries, never as the card's total — Planka serves comments 50
  at a time and ignores `?limit`/`?page`, so the old field was a page size
  wearing a total's name.
- Errors say what to do next: a **403** names the likely cause (the agent user is
  not a board member, or is a viewer where an editor is needed) and warns that
  Planka answers 404 for it too; a **404** keeps Planka's own message and names
  the kind of ID the path expected (`labelId`, `listId`…); a **401** that
  survives the automatic retry points at `PLANKA_API_KEY` /
  `PLANKA_AGENT_PASSWORD` instead of at the session; **HTML instead of JSON**
  names the SPA catch-all and, on a write, warns that it MAY have landed;
  **network failures** carry the base URL.
- `planka_view_attachment` on a card with no attachments says there is nothing
  to view, instead of asking for an `attachmentId` and listing "none".
- `CardIncludedSchema` covers what Planka 2.2 really sends (`cardMemberships`,
  `users`, `customFields`, `customFieldValues`) and the card schema tolerates
  `commentsTotal`, `isDueCompleted`, `isClosed` and `stopwatch`. Enums stay open
  strings on read paths.
- **Read response shapes changed** (the tool names did not): `planka_list_cards`
  answers `matches` where it used to answer `cards`, `warning` (a string) became
  `warnings` (an array) on `planka_find_cards`, the per-card `list` is now
  `listName` and appears only when the result spans several columns, and
  `planka_board_summary` no longer defaults to Spanish column and label names.
- **A `200` is no longer a success.** `planka_create_card`, `planka_update_card`,
  `planka_move_card`, `planka_delete_card`, `planka_create_tasks`,
  `planka_update_task`, `planka_delete_task`, `planka_manage_labels`,
  `planka_add_comment`, `planka_manage_comment`, `planka_manage_lists` and
  `planka_delete_attachment` now re-read before reporting.
- `planka_create_card` counts the tasks and labels **that are on the card**, not
  the ones requested, always returns `card.id` (even when a follow-up step
  fails, so a retry does not duplicate the card), and errors when every
  requested label failed to attach.
- `planka_update_card`, `planka_update_task`, `planka_manage_labels update` and
  `planka_manage_lists update` reject a request carrying only an id
  (`nothing to do`) instead of sending an empty PATCH and reporting success.
- `planka_manage_lists` says in its description and in the docs that deleting a
  list deletes every card in it.
- `PlankaClient.delete()` returns the response body instead of `void`: Planka
  2.x echoes the deleted item, and its parent id is what makes the confirmation
  read possible.
- Label `color` is a real JSON Schema `enum` of the 43 colors instead of a
  sentence in the description, so the client rejects a bad color before the
  call. (Measured: 599 chars against 580 — this is a correctness win, not a
  token saving.)
- Tool payloads are serialized without indentation (`JSON.stringify(x)`),
  27–46 % fewer characters on the read-heavy tools at zero information cost.
- Tool descriptions are shorter. The prose that was repeated across many of them
  — that IDs are strings, that `planka_get_board` is the expensive call, the
  meaning of `total`/`returned`/`hasMore` — now lives in the server
  instructions, as the spec asks. The sum of all descriptions went from 3658 to
  2093 characters; no `inputSchema` changed.
- `getToolDefinitions()` now propagates `title`, `annotations` and `_meta`. It
  previously mapped only name, description and schema, which would have dropped
  them from `tools/list` without any error.

### Fixed

- `planka_move_list_cards` answered 403 "Not enough rights" on any ordinary
  column-to-column move. `POST /api/lists/:id/move-cards` is not the general
  bulk move its name suggests: Planka 2.2.1 refuses anything but a `closed`
  source into an `archive` destination, and the refusal reads like a permission
  problem. The tool now falls back to one PATCH per card, keeps each card's
  position, and reports which path it took plus any card that refused to move.
- Restoring a card out of the archive sent only `listId`, and Planka answered
  *"Position must be present"* — an archived card has `position: null`. The
  restore path now always sends a position. Caught against a real Planka 2.2.1,
  not in a mock.
- `getCardsForList` derives Planka's page size from the first response instead
  of assuming 50. An instance answering 20 per page used to stop on page one and
  report a third of a column as the whole of it, with `truncated: false`.
- The card schema accepts `commentsTotal`, `isClosed` and `isDueCompleted`,
  including the `null` Planka actually sends — reading them as booleans would
  have made every board read fail.
- `planka_find_cards` no longer returns `listId` **and** `list` on every match:
  a search scoped to one column names it once, at the root.
- `planka_get_card` no longer swallows a failing comments endpoint into
  `comments: []`. A 403, a timeout or an HTML answer now surfaces as an error:
  "this card has no comments" and "I could not read them" are different facts,
  and on a board whose memory lives in the comments the difference is expensive.
- Server instructions in the `initialize` handshake
  (`InitializeResult.instructions`, `src/instructions.ts`). Claude Code injects
  them into the session system prompt and Codex CLI reads them alongside the
  tool list, so the guidance shared by many tools is stated once: open with
  `planka_board_summary` and never `planka_get_board`, IDs are strings of digits
  that come from `planka_get_structure` or `planka_board_summary`, read every
  comment on a card before acting, reads return digests with
  `total`/`returned`/`hasMore`, writes report `verified` and `finalLabelIds`,
  and Planka answers `404` where it means `403`. Budgeted at 1500-2500
  characters, with the first 512 self-contained for clients that truncate.
- Tool annotations on all twenty-four tools: a display `title` plus
  `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint` and `openWorldHint`, every
  field written out rather than inherited. The spec defaults are pessimistic, so
  without them a conformant client had to treat `planka_get_comments` as being
  as destructive as `planka_delete_card`.
- The two Anthropic `_meta` keys Claude Code actually acts on:
  `anthropic/requiresUserInteraction` on `planka_delete_card`,
  `planka_delete_task`, `planka_delete_attachment`, `planka_manage_comment`,
  `planka_manage_lists` and `planka_manage_labels`, which forces the permission
  prompt even under an `allow` rule; and `anthropic/maxResultSizeChars` on
  `planka_view_attachment`, so a 3 MB base64 image is not clipped.
- Tests that keep all of the above honest: every registered tool must have an
  annotations entry (a new tool without one fails the suite), the tools marked
  as needing confirmation must carry the `_meta` flag, the instructions must fit
  their budget, and `tools/list` must return a fixed, snapshotted tool order.
- **API key authentication.** `PLANKA_API_KEY` sends `X-Api-Key` on every
  request — JSON calls, multipart uploads and binary attachment downloads alike
  — with no login round-trip and no token refresh. It also sidesteps Planka's
  sign-in rate limit of ten logins per identity per minute, which several agents
  starting at once will otherwise hit. Configuration is now API key XOR
  email/password: setting both is refused rather than guessed, because Planka
  reads `Authorization` first and silently ignores `x-api-key` when both arrive.
- **Access policy driven by environment variables**, in `src/config/policy.ts`:
  `PLANKA_DEFAULT_BOARD_ID`, `PLANKA_ALLOWED_BOARD_IDS`,
  `PLANKA_ALLOWED_PROJECT_IDS`, `PLANKA_READ_ONLY`, `PLANKA_DISABLED_TOOLS` and
  `PLANKA_PROTECTED_LIST_IDS`. Allowlists are by id, never by name: a name is one
  edit away from being someone else's.
- **`boardId` is now optional** on every tool that takes one, whenever
  `PLANKA_DEFAULT_BOARD_ID` is configured. It is removed from the tool's
  `required` list and the description says where the default comes from, so an
  agent stops calling `planka_get_structure` just to recover an id that never
  changes.
- **`PLANKA_READ_ONLY` and `PLANKA_DISABLED_TOOLS` hide tools and refuse them.**
  Hidden tools disappear from `tools/list`, and calling one anyway returns an
  error that names the variable responsible and says not to retry — hiding alone
  is not enough for a client working from a cached list.
- **Allowlist filtering in `planka_get_structure`**, so an agent never sees the
  boards and projects it may not touch, and a `projectId` that does not exist now
  answers with the visible projects instead of an empty array.
- `server.json`: the new environment variables, plus `title`, `websiteUrl` and
  `icons` for the MCP Registry listing. `PLANKA_AGENT_EMAIL` and
  `PLANKA_AGENT_PASSWORD` are no longer marked required.
- README (English and Spanish): *Authentication* — including the four-step recipe
  for a scoped `boardUser` with an API key — and *Scoping the server*, with the
  three-layer model and the variable matrix. New entries in
  `docs/troubleshooting.md` for every new error message.
- Binary attachment downloads now retry once on a 401 with a fresh token, the way
  every other request already did. Before, an expired token during a download
  surfaced as a bare authentication failure.
- A `200` carrying the SPA's HTML instead of JSON — what Planka answers for any
  path it does not route, and what an `http://` base URL redirected to `https://`
  ends up producing — is now reported as such on every request, not only during
  login.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Nine tools, bringing the server to twenty-four.
- Attachments: `planka_add_attachment` uploads a local file and re-reads the card
  to confirm it landed, `planka_get_attachments` lists what a card holds,
  `planka_view_attachment` returns content — images as MCP image content up to
  3 MB, text inline up to 50 KB, anything else as metadata and a URL — and
  `planka_delete_attachment` removes one.
- `planka_manage_comment`, to edit or delete an existing comment.
- Scoped reads that answer a narrower question than `planka_get_board` and return
  proportionally less text: `planka_list_lists` (columns and card counts),
  `planka_board_summary` (columns, labels, and the cards awaiting a decision),
  `planka_list_cards` (one column, paginated), and `planka_find_cards` (search by
  label, text, or column). Measured on a board of 100 cards, they return between
  16 and 56 times less than `planka_get_board`.
- Honest clipping on every scoped read: `total`, `returned`, `hasMore`, and
  `nextOffset`, so a partial answer is never mistaken for a complete one.
- Actionable input errors. A rejected call now names the tool, the field, the
  declared type and description, what was expected, and what actually arrived.
  Missing required fields are caught before the handler runs, and a Planka
  response that does not match the expected shape is labelled as an API mismatch
  rather than an argument problem.
- Diagnosis for a project ID passed where a board ID belongs. Both are strings of
  digits, and Planka answers the mistake with a bare 404. The server now resolves
  it automatically when the project has exactly one board, and otherwise explains
  what the ID is and lists the boards it could have meant.
- Documentation for the smoke test's optional environment variables:
  `PLANKA_SMOKE_LIST_ID` and `PLANKA_SMOKE_FAIL_AFTER`, which injects a failure to
  prove the cleanup path still runs.

### Changed

- The smoke test grew from a first-failure abort over seven tools to 64 named
  checks covering all twenty-four end to end, each write cross-checked against the
  raw Planka HTTP API. Cleanup runs in a `finally` and on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`, over
  raw HTTP so the safety net does not depend on the component under test.
- `npm run test:smoke` builds first, so it can no longer test a stale `dist/`.
- Internal operation signatures take a single input object everywhere, validated
  through one shared path. No tool payload changed.

### Fixed

- Long columns truncated in silence. `GET /api/lists/:id/cards` pages at 50 and
  ignores `?limit=`; its cursor is composite (`before[id]` plus
  `before[listChangedAt]`). A column of 77 cards returned 50 with no indication
  that 27 were missing. The cursor is now followed, and a read that still could
  not be completed reports `truncated: true` instead of looking complete.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-21

### Identity

- Working repository name: `planka-mcp`.
- Working npm identity: `@omnicoreos/planka-mcp`.
- `project.identity.json` is the source of truth for repository, package, binary,
  MCP Registry, and repository URL names. After changing it, run
  `npm run sync:identity`.

### Added

- Fifteen stdio MCP tools for Planka projects, boards, cards, tasks, comments,
  labels, and lists.
- Guided macOS/Linux setup with authentication validation, board selection,
  optional board bootstrap, Claude Code configuration, and real smoke verification.
- Unit tests for schemas, parsing, request construction, the dedicated comments
  endpoint, label criteria deletion, label aliases, list creation, and bootstrap
  idempotency.
- Opt-in smoke test that executes MCP tools and verifies every mutation against the
  raw Planka API before deleting its temporary card.
- Optional board, director/worker, and worktree methodology.
- English and Spanish documentation.

### Fixed from upstream

- Empty comments on Planka 2.x.
- Whole-board failures caused by new label colors.
- Silent no-op `labelIds` requests.
- Incorrect label-removal URL.
- Missing `type` in list creation.
- Internal `archive` and `trash` list types rejected on board reads.
